For installation on Linux machines.

1.  Download and unpack the .zip file from the repository.
2.  Download and install Google Protocol Buffers from the google/protobuf repository. Make sure the libraries are       
    installed in /usr/lib and not /usr/local/lib by running the initial ./configure with the "--prefix=/usr" flag.
    Otherwise, you will need to make sure /usr/local/lib is in your library path.
3.  For the unit tests, make sure you have the Google testing framework installed.
4.  If you wish to generate documentation, make sure Doxygen is installed.
5.  To compile the program, run make in the project directory.
6.  To run the program, type ./main followed by the name of the file that will be used by the protocol buffers
    to load and save the objects.
7.  If you wish to compile and run the unit tests, compile them with "make tests" and run with ./tests

Instructions on how to use the program (i.e. create machines, set IDs, list machines, and exit) are presented during execution.
